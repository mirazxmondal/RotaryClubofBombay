        The Rotary Club of Bombay is one of the pioneers in India of the rotary
        movement, devoted to the ideal of Fellowship through service. It was
        founded on March 19, 1929. The Club meets every Tuesday at 1.15 p.m. at
        the Taj Mahal Hotel, the very place where the founders had their first
        get-together. The first president of the club was Rtn. Charles N.
        Moberley. Sir Phiroze Sethna, one of India’s most illustrious sons, was
        the only Indian among the other European founder members and the first
        Board consisted of only eight members. Most clubs in Dist 3140 can trace
        their roots to the Rotary Club of Bombay.

        Reading the list of subsequent presidents is like scanning the ‘Who’s
        who’ of Bombay of the time, bearing names of personalities who even to
        this day have left their mark on the multifaceted life of this great
        Metropolis. Amongst the first few presidents of the Club we have had
        names like Sir Shapoorjee Billimoria, Sir Sultan Chinoy, Sir Jamshedji
        Duggan, Sir Vithal Chandavarkar, Sir Francis Low, Sir Behram Karanjia
        and many others.

        Rotary Club of Bombay a membership compromising a high performance
        cross-section of Bombay’s successful business and professional men and
        women, all accomplishers in their own field ranging from doctors to
        architects, legal luminaries to bankers, entrepreneurs to

        From the very beginning the pulse of Rotary has been and always will be
        Community Service. Today the Rotary Club of Bombay has diversified its
        activities through the work of over fifty committees constituted to look
        after the various avenues of service. Of these, over 20 contribute to
        community service. The Club has been able to attempt a number of service
        programmes only because of generous donations of time and money by the
        members.
